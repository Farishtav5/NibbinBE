        "shortDesc": "According to a meta-analysis presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress, adults who napped more than 1 hour per day, had an elevated risk for CVD and mortality compared with those who did not nap at all. It is believed by many that day-time napping counteracts the negative consequences of ‘sleep debt’, however, this analysis counters this widely held opinion.",

Mavacamten’s third trial demonstrates hat the first-in-class drug can perform as a disease-specific therapy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM, by preventing the thickened heart muscle associated with the disease from obstructing the flow of blood.",
